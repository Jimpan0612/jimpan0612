## ![About Me](https://via.placeholder.com/15/3498db/000000?text=+) About Me

**Hi, I'm Chun-Yen Pan, a passionate Data Analyst with a knack for Social Data Analytics and Research.**

I have a background in Political Science and Big Data Analysis from Soochow University in Taiwan. Additionally, I hold a [Master of Science in Social Data Analytics and Research](https://www.utdallas.edu/fact-sheets/epps/ms-social-data-analytics-and-research/) from UTD. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis (R, Python) and its application in social settings. My goal is to develop visualizations that can enhance the impact of research outcomes. I am eager to contribute to resolving international conflicts through my work in data-driven policy analysis.
