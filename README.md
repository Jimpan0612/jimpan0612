I have a Political Science and Big Data Analysis background from Soochow University in Taiwan. Additionally, I hold a Master of Science in Social Data Analytics and Research from UTD. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis (R, Python) and its application in social settings. These programs have sharpened my analytical skills and taught me how to effectively link digital insights with international politics. My goal is to develop visualizations that can enhance the impact of research outcomes. I am eager to contribute to resolving international conflicts through my work in data-driven policy analysis.
